# scrna_practice
- This is a practical scRNA seq workflow guided by a postdoc in a lab.
- I used Seurat packages to deploy most of steps referenced by Seurat official tutorials.
- Main goal is to identify Myeloid cluster and within that to identify sub clusters based on marker genes referenced by Villani paper.
